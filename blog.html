    <h1>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
    <ul>
<li>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped .var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; var variables are initialized with undefined</li>
<li>let variables are block scoped. let variables can be updated but not re-declared;</li>
<li> const variables are block scoped. const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</li>
<p>
      
            They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while , let and const variables are not initialized.
            While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</p>
    </ul>

<h1>
    the use cases of null and undefined
</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.When a variable is `undefined`, or unitialized, in most programming languages it means that a space in memory has been assigned to a variable name, but the programmer has not yet done anything with that space in memory. This usually results in a compile time error.</li>
    <li>Null means an empty value or a blank value. When a variable is `null` in other programming languages, null is typically a keyword to indicate the space in memory is a pointer (reference), and that pointer is pointing to an invalid memory address (usually 0x0). This is usually used when a programmer is done using the value of a variable and wants to purposefully clear it by literally pointing it to nothing. </li>
</ul>

<h1>
    What do you mean by REST API?
</h1>
<ul>
    <li>REST is an acronym for rpresentational State Transfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. Roy Fielding first presented it in 2000 in his famous dissertation. A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.</li>
